<p>Dear APSE member,</p>

<p>Here at APSE we are excited to partner in a research study carried out at the University of Massachusetts Boston and the University of Minnesota. This research study aims to improve the quality of employment services available to job seekers with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD).</p>

<p>I hope that you too will consider partnering with this project. You can help if your organization has at least three direct service staff who assist job seekers with IDD in finding paid individual employment. Please let the researchers know about your interest by filling out this short survey about your program. It will take less than five minutes.</p>

<p><a class="btn btn-primary" href="https://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/2458902/CRP">Take the survey</a></p>

<p>The information that you submit will help the researchers to identify eligible employment programs that represent diversity across a number of factors including job seekers' support needs, community characteristics, and support strategies. After submitting the survey, you can expect the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>If your program qualifies for participation—and you will agree to collaborate at that time—research staff will ask you to forward an invitation email to all direct service staff in your organization who work full time and who have at least one year experience supporting job seekers with IDD.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The direct service staff will be asked to complete a baseline survey (15 minutes one time), four quarterly surveys (15 minutes each), and a daily survey for smartphones (one minute per day for a year). Overall the study is estimated to take about five hours total over the course of one year.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>By partnering in this study, you will receive a final report of aggregated anonymous findings. You may find this information useful for determining effective employment support practices.</p>

<p>For more information about the study, please check the frequently asked questions listed below. If you have additional questions or any concerns, please contact Alberto Migliore, at alberto.migliore@umb.edu or at 617-287-4306.</p>

<p>Thank you, and we hope that you'll join us as partners in this research study.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

<p><strong>What's the purpose of this study?</strong></p>

<p>To increase our understanding about effective employment support practices for assisting adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) in finding paid individual employment. We hope that this will improve the quality of employment services available to this population, and thus advance their employment outcomes, self-sufficiency, and quality of life.</p>

<p><strong>Why are you asking me to participate?</strong></p>

<p>Because of your expertise providing direct support services to job seekers with IDD leading to paid individual employment.</p>

<p><strong>How do I know if my staff members qualify for this study?</strong></p>

<p>A staff member qualifies for this study if his/her response is "yes" to ALL of the following questions:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>His/her primary responsibility is assisting job seekers in finding paid individual employment.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>He/she has at least one year of experience in this role.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>He/she works full time.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>At least 50% of his/her caseload includes job seekers with IDD.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>He/she regularly uses a smartphone at work.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>What are participants asked to do, and how much time it will take?</strong></p>

<p>During the course of one year, participants will complete an online baseline survey (15 minutes), four online quarterly surveys (15 minutes each), and a short online daily survey for smartphones (one minute every workday for a year). Participation will take about five hours in total.</p>

<p><strong>What questions are you asking in the baseline survey?</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Participants' demographic characteristics (e.g., gender, age, race, etc.)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Participants' professional characteristics (e.g., work hours, tenure, etc.)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Job seekers' outcomes (e.g., number of job seekers who found employment, their wages, and their work hours)</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>What questions are you asking in the quarterly survey?</strong></p>

<p>The quarterly survey mirrors the baseline survey, without the demographic characteristics.</p>

<p><strong>What questions are you asking in the short daily survey for smartphones?</strong></p>

<p>What activities participants were performing, with whom they were interacting, and where they were during the half hour before receiving a text message on their phones. Three more questions ask how many employers were contacted, how many job interviews were facilitated, and how many new jobs were negotiated the day before receiving the text message.</p>

<p><strong>How will the surveys be delivered?</strong></p>

<p>Links to the online password-protected baseline survey and quarterly surveys will be delivered through email. The link to the online daily survey will be delivered through text messages to the participants' smartphones, each work day at a random time during work hours.</p>

<p><strong>What kind of phone do participants need to have?</strong></p>

<p>All smartphones work, including Android devices, iOS/iPhones, phones running Windows, etc. If someone can browse the Internet with the phone, the device works for this study.</p>

<p><strong>What if a participant is not at work?</strong></p>

<p>Participants will not receive the daily survey on weekends, holidays, or when they report not being at work.</p>

<p><strong>What if a participant agrees to participate and then he/she changes his/her mind?</strong></p>

<p>Participants can ask to stop participation temporarily or permanently at any time.</p>

<p><strong>Are participants going to incur expenses if using their personal phones?</strong></p>

<p>Participants might incur an expense if their phone plans do NOT include unlimited text messaging. We recommend that participants check with their phone carriers. Also, the daily survey will consume some data from data plans. However, the amount of used data is negligible. If participants are concerned about data usage, we recommend they check with their carriers.</p>

<p><strong>If a phone plan charges for text messages, how much could it cost?</strong></p>

<p>If a carrier charges $0.10 per text message, the total cost of receiving one text message per day over the one-year period could fall between $24 (no reminders needed) and $72 (two daily reminders needed) total. We encourage participants to check the actual cost of text messaging with their phone carriers.</p>

<p><strong>What will direct service staff gain from participating?</strong></p>

<p>Your direct service staffwill receive a final report of aggregated anonymous findings regarding effective employment support practices. They may find this information useful for determining which of these practices to use in their daily work. Moreover, we hope that they will feel gratified by contributing to research designed to improve the quality of employment services available to job seekers. Finally, as a token of appreciation, each direct service staff will receive a $20 gift card each quarter, for a total of $80 by the end of the study.</p>

<p><strong>How is information kept confidential?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Only authorized, trained staff will have access to the data.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>All survey data will be kept in password-protected computers.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>We will permanently delete the files when the study and retention period is complete.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The study has been reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Massachusetts Boston to comply with federal law about the protection of human subjects.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Who else is going to participate in this study?</strong></p>

<p>We are recruiting about 150 direct service staff from about 50 employment programs, nationally.</p>

<p><strong>What's the tentative timeline of the study?</strong></p>

<p>The project will launch in the spring of 2016 and will end in the spring of 2017.</p>
