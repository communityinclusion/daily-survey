    <div class="jumbotron" style="background-color:#0076B1; color:white;">      <center><h3>FAQs about the longitudinal study on employment supports (For employment consultants)</h3></div>

    <div class="container">



      <p><strong>What's the purpose of this study?</strong></p>

      <p>We want to better understand how employment support strategies are implemented, and identify their relationships with employment outcomes and benchmarks for best practice. We hope that the findings will contribute to advance employment of job seekers with disabilities.</p>

      <p><strong>Why are you asking me to participate?</strong></p>

      <p>Because of your work promoting employment of adults with disabilities.</p>

      <p><strong>How do I know if I qualify for this study?</strong></p>

      <p>You qualify for this study if your response is "yes" to ALL of the following questions:</p>

      <ol>
      <li>You work full time</li>
      <li>Your primary responsibility is assisting job seekers in finding paid individual employment (i.e. at least minimum wage and majority of co-workers without disabilities)</li>
      <li>You have at least one year of experience in this role</li>
      <li>At least 50% of your caseload includes job seekers with IDD</li>
      <li>You use a smartphone at work</li>
      </ol>


      <p><strong>What am I asked to do, and how much time it will take?</strong></p>

      <p>During the course of one year, you will complete an online baseline survey (15 minutes), four online quarterly surveys (15 minutes each), and a short online daily survey for smartphones (one minute every workday for a year). Participation will take about five hours in total.</p>

      <p><strong>What questions are you asking in the baseline survey?</strong></p>

      <ol>
      <li>Your demographics (e.g., gender, age, race, etc.)</li>
      <li>Your professional characteristics (e.g., work hours, tenure, etc.)</li>
      <li>Job seekers' outcomes (e.g., number of job seekers who found employment with your support, and wages and work hours of most recent hire)</li>
      </ol>


      <p><strong>What questions are you asking in the quarterly survey?</strong></p>

      <p>The quarterly survey mirrors the baseline survey.</p>

      <p><strong>What questions are you asking in the short daily survey for smartphones?</strong></p>

      <p>What activities you were performing (e.g. getting to know job seekers, finding jobs, paperwork etc.), with whom you were interacting (e.g. job seekers, employers, colleagues etc.), and where you were (e.g. In office, at a workplace, driving etc.) during the half hour before receiving a text message on your phone. Three more questions ask how many employers you contacted, how many job interviews you facilitated, and how many new jobs you negotiated the day before.</p>

      <p><strong>How will the surveys be delivered?</strong></p>

      <p>Links to the baseline survey and quarterly surveys will be delivered to your email. The link to the online daily survey will be delivered through text messages to your smartphone, once each work day at a random time during work hours.</p>

      <p><strong>Will my phone work for this project?</strong></p>

      <p>If you can browse the Internet with your phone, your device works for this study. Android phones, iOS/iPhones, phones running Windows, etc., all work.</p>

      <p><strong>What if I am not at work when I receive a text message?</strong></p>

      <p>You will not receive the daily survey on weekends, holidays, or when you report not being at work (e.g vacation or sick days).</p>

      <p><strong>What if I agree to participate and then I change my mind?</strong></p>

      <p>You can always ask to stop participation temporarily or permanently at any time without any consequence. Or you can skip individual questions.</p>

      <p><strong>Am I going to incur expenses if using my personal phone?</strong></p>

      <p>You might incur an expense if your phone plan does NOT include unlimited text messaging. We recommend that you check with your phone carrier. Also, the daily survey will consume some data from data plans. However, the amount of used data is negligible. If you are concerned about data usage, we recommend you check with your carrier.</p>

      <p><strong>If a phone plan charges for text messages, how much could it cost?</strong></p>

      <p>As an example, if a carrier charges $0.10 per text message, the total cost of receiving one text message per day over the one-year period could fall between $24 (no reminders needed) and $72 (two daily reminders needed) total. We encourage you to check the actual cost of text messaging with your phone carrier.</p>

      <p><strong>What will I gain from participating?</strong></p>

      <p>You will receive summaries of aggregated findings throughout the one year of duration of the study. Moreover, we hope that you will feel gratified by contributing to research designed to promote employment of adults with disabilities. Finally, as a token of appreciation, you will receive a $20 gift card each quarter, for a total of $80 by the end of the study.</p>

      <p><strong>How is my information kept confidential?</strong></p>

      <ul>
      <li>Only authorized, trained staff will have access to the data</li>
      <li>All data will be kept in password-protected computers</li>
      <li>We will permanently delete the files when the study and retention period is complete</li>
      <li>The study has been reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Massachusetts Boston to comply with federal law about the protection of human subjects</li>
      </ul>


      <p><strong>Who else is going to participate in this study?</strong></p>

      <p>We are recruiting about 150 employment consultants from about 50 employment programs, nationally.</p>

      <p><strong>What's the timeline of the study?</strong></p>

      <p>The project will tentatively launch in the spring of 2016 and will end in the spring of 2017.</p>
