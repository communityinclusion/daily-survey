    <div class="jumbotron" style="background-color:#0076B1; color:white;">      <center><h3>FAQs about the daily survey on effective employment supports research study</h3></div>

    <div class="container">

      <p><strong>What's the purpose of this study?</strong></p>

      <p>To increase our understanding about effective employment support practices for assisting adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) in finding paid individual employment. We hope that this will improve the quality of employment services available to this population, and thus advance their employment outcomes, self-sufficiency, and quality of life.</p>

      <p><strong>Why are you asking me to participate?</strong></p>

      <p>Because of you demonstrated interest in promoting effective employment support services for adults with disabilities.</p>

      <p><strong>How do I know if my staff members qualify for this study?</strong></p>

      <p>A staff member qualifies for this study if his/her response is "yes" to ALL of the following questions:</p>

      <ol>
      <li>His/her primary responsibility is assisting job seekers in finding paid individual employment.</li>
      <li>He/she has at least one year of experience in this role.</li>
      <li>He/she works full time.</li>
      <li>At least 50% of his/her caseload includes job seekers with IDD.</li>
      <li>He/she regularly uses a smartphone at work.</li>
      </ol>


      <p><strong>What are participants asked to do, and</strong>  <strong>how much time it will take?</strong></p>

      <p>During the course of one year, participants will complete an online baseline survey (15 minutes), four online quarterly surveys (15 minutes each), and a short online daily survey for smartphones (one minute every workday for a year). Participation will take about five hours in total.</p>

      <p><strong>What questions are you asking in the baseline survey?</strong></p>

      <ol>
      <li>Participants' demographic characteristics (e.g., gender, age, race, etc.)</li>
      <li>Participants' professional characteristics (e.g., work hours, tenure, etc.)</li>
      <li>Job seekers' outcomes (e.g., number of job seekers who found employment, their wages, and their work hours)</li>
      </ol>


      <p><strong>What questions are you asking in the quarterly survey?</strong></p>

      <p>The quarterly survey mirrors the baseline survey, without the demographic characteristics.</p>

      <p><strong>What questions are you asking in the short daily survey for smartphones?</strong></p>

      <p>What activities participants were performing, with whom they were interacting, and where they were during the half hour before receiving a text message on their phones. Three more questions ask how many employers were contacted, how many job interviews were facilitated, and how many new jobs were negotiated the day before receiving the text message.</p>

      <p><strong>How will the surveys be delivered?</strong></p>

      <p>Links to the online password-protected baseline survey and quarterly surveys will be delivered through email. The link to the online daily survey will be delivered through text messages to the participants' smartphones, each work day at a random time during work hours.</p>

      <p><strong>What kind of phone do participants need to have?</strong></p>

      <p>All smartphones work, including Android devices, iOS/iPhones, phones running Windows, etc. If someone can browse the Internet with the phone, the device works for this study.</p>

      <p><strong>What if a participant is not at work?</strong></p>

      <p>Participants will not receive the daily survey on weekends, holidays, or when they report not being at work.</p>

      <p><strong>What if a participant agrees to participate and then he/she changes his/her mind?</strong></p>

      <p>Participants can ask to stop participation temporarily or permanently at any time.</p>

      <p><strong>Are participants going to incur expenses if using their personal phones?</strong></p>

      <p>Participants might incur an expense if their phone plans do NOT include unlimited text messaging. We recommend that participants check with their phone carriers. Also, the daily survey will consume some data from data plans. However, the amount of used data is negligible. If participants are concerned about data usage, we recommend they check with their carriers.</p>

      <p><strong>If a phone plan charges for text messages, how much could it cost?</strong></p>

      <p>If a carrier charges $0.10 per text message, the total cost of receiving one text message per day over the one-year period could fall between $24 (no reminders needed) and $72 (two daily reminders needed) total. We encourage participants to check the actual cost of text messaging with their phone carriers.</p>

      <p><strong>What will direct service staff gain from participating?</strong></p>

      <p>Your direct service staffwill receive a final report of aggregated anonymous findings regarding effective employment support practices. They may find this information useful for determining which of these practices to use in their daily work. Moreover, we hope that they will feel gratified by contributing to research designed to improve the quality of employment services available to job seekers. Finally, as a token of appreciation, each direct service staff will receive a $20 gift card each quarter, for a total of $80 by the end of the study.</p>

      <p><strong>How is information kept confidential?</strong></p>

      <ul>
      <li>Only authorized, trained staff will have access to the data.</li>
      <li>All survey data will be kept in password-protected computers.</li>
      <li>We will permanently delete the files when the study and retention period is complete.</li>
      <li>The study has been reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Massachusetts Boston to comply with federal law about the protection of human subjects.</li>
      </ul>


      <p><strong>Who else is going to participate in this study?</strong></p>

      <p>We are recruiting about 150 direct service staff from about 50 employment programs, nationally.</p>

      <p><strong>What's the tentative timeline of the study?</strong></p>

      <p>The project will launch in the spring of 2016 and will end in the spring of 2017.</p>
